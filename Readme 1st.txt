You must download openSSL before you run this program! It is just a GUI for openSSL!
you can obtain openSSL from: http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html

You must then copy openSSL.exe and any of it's required DLL files to the folder
in which CA.exe is stored so the commands can be sent correctly.
